## How to Play
- Start the Game: Press any key on the keyboard to start the game.

- Watch the Sequence: The game will show you a sequence of button presses by flashing the buttons and playing sounds. The sequence starts with one button and adds an additional button each round.

- Repeat the Sequence: After watching the sequence, it's your turn to repeat it by clicking the buttons in the same order. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add another button to the sequence and you move to the next level.

- Game Over: If you click the wrong button, the game will play a "wrong" sound and the screen will flash to indicate a game over. The game will display "Game Over, Press Any Key to Restart" and wait for you to 
start over.
